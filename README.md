# pytc-demos
This is a collection of demo [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
that show how to use the [pytc](https://github.com/harmslab/pytc) API to fit
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry experiments.  The notebooks are (roughly) 
arranged from simple to more complex fits. Full documentation for the API is on
[readthdocs](https://pytc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

To use the notebooks, you must first 
[install jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
and Python3.
